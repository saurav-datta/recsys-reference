 - This system isn't always active. The engine calculates a "breadth value" for every query
 - If a query is narrow—for example, "what is the capital of France"—the system recognizes a singular intent and skips thematic generation. The AI only intervenes when the query is broad enough to benefit from synthesis, ensuring the tech stays out of the way of simple facts.
